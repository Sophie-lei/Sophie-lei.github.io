										<h2>Pay-to-use Invoice System</h2>
										<p>I helped with  Festo Pay-to-Use Project which can generate monthly invoices for the pay-to-use system for every machine user. It used blockchain to pay and we get the payment detail of the clients. I set the invoice to generate a function for each payment and send it to the client every month. Customers can also pay by the middle of the month and generate the invoice. </p>
