									<h2><a href="#">Who I am</a></h2>
									<p>        My name is Sophie Lei, I am 24 years old, and I am from Shanghai, China. Welcome to my digital portfolio. 
										Currently, I am a senior computer science student at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
										I am actively seeking job and research opportunities.
										Through this digital portfolio. You can find my resume, my interests, my experience, and how to connect me. 
										Please feel free to contact me if you think I am suited for the position. 
										Since I was in high school I am fascinated with video gaming development and software development. 
										I created a 2D pixel game called Dreamily. It can detect any image in the real world and show the 2D version in the game. 
										After I win 6th in the hackathon, I decided to deep learn this field and choose a computer science major at the university. 
										My family is very supportive, I am glad that they encourage me to try whatever I am interested in and not afraid of failing. 
										After I enrolled University of Colorado Boulder in 2019, I find my interest in Artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
										So I take many related classes and try to implement them in my software development project. I am also a student assistant at NSIDC, which is the National Snow and Ice Department Center.  
										Other than programming, some of my other interests include dancing, hiking, and traveling.  I would describe myself as a diligent, punctual, and energetic person. 
										I like challenges and enjoy the way I get through them. I am curious about many things and willing to give them a try. I take myself as a person that also continues learning and I believe it is more important than intelligence.

									<p>I have created a poster appealing to people to donate to homeless animal shelters. Because I love animals a lot, I went to the animal shelters and ask whether I can help with this. Finally, we collected $200 for animals. This is the picture that the shelter faculty take of me playing with dogs. </p>
